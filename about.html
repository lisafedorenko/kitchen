<h1> Corporate Kitchen </h1>

<h2> The story </h2>
<p>

It is hard to fit affordable healthy eating into a busy lifestyle. Whether you're working long hours in the city, running your own business, studying or raising a family - cooking can be arduous and time-consuming, going out isn't always an option and it is hard to find take-away that is consistently cheap, healthy and tasty. Even grabbing take-away will likely take 30 mins out of your schedule - assuming a 10 min purchase time and 10 min walk to your favourite vendour.  
</p>
<p>
For me - the needle really dropped when I was working in the city over the Xmas period when most of my go-to-take-away options shut-down for the break. I decided it was time to find an alternative.
</p>
<p>
It all started with a salad. That was easy enough to make in a micro kitchen. :)
</p>
<p>
But then things escalated.... after all you can't make friends with salad!!
</p>
<p>

So I started experimenting... could I make steak? Fish? Lamb? Why not?! Turns out this is reasonably novel - so I wanted to share how I make the meals as an alternative option to:
<ol>
<li> Cheap junk food nearby</li> 
<li> Expensive healthy food nearby</li> 
<li> Being organised enough to pack your lunch ahead of time - which /I certainly am not =P</li> 
</ol>

</p>
<h2> About my work kitchen </h2>

<p>

My work kitchen is reasonably small - and quite representative of what most small businesses or corporates may have themselves. It contains:
<ol>
<li> A benchtop</li> 
<li> A fridge</li> 
<li> A cupboard</li> 
<li> A microwave</li> 
<li> A sandwich press</li> 
<li> A toaster</li> 
<li> Plates/ bowls</li> 
<li> Knives/ forks - including one sharp knife</li> 

</ol>

</p>

<h2> The recipes </h2>

<h3> Timing </h3>

<p>

Most of the recipes take sub 10 minutes. In general the bottleneck for timing tends to be the choice of carb. Salads are the fastests - only requiring a few minutes to assemble. Brown rice less than a min, cous cous takes 3, potatoes 8, quinoa 10.

</p>

<h3> Nutrition </h3>

<p>

I try and eat healthy - this is quite hard and vague - there are so many different tips on how to eat well and in general I find it quite confusing. So the rule I've tried to stick to with these recipes is:
1 x serve of carb
1-2 x serve of protein
1+ serve of greens/ vegetables
1+ something a little tasty
